# Interpolations

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tlycken/Interpolations.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tlycken/Interpolations.jl)

This package is the continuation of Tim Holy's work on [Grid.jl](https://github.com/timholy/Grid.jl), and specifically the metaprogramming based approach outlined [here](https://github.com/timholy/Grid.jl/pull/38).

Work is very much in progress, but there's an [IJulia notebook](nbviewer.ipython.org/github/tlycken/Interpolations.jl/blob/doc/doc/Interpolations.jl.ipynb) that shows off some of the current functionality, and outlines where we're headed. Also, take a look at issue [#5 - our feature wishlist](https://github.com/tlycken/Interpolations.jl/issues/5) =)
