# Interpolations

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tlycken/Interpolations.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tlycken/Interpolations.jl)

This package is the continuation of Tim Holy's work on [Grid.jl](https://github.com/timholy/Grid.jl), and specifically the metaprogramming based approach outlined [here](https://github.com/timholy/Grid.jl/pull/38).

Work is very much in progress (at a very varying pace...)
